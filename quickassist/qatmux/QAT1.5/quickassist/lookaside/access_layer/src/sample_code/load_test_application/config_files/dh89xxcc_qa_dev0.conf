#
# Logical Instances Section
# A logical instance allows each address domain
# (kernel space and individual user space processes)
# to configure rings (i.e. hardware assisted queues)
# to be used by that address domain and to define the
# behavior of that ring.
#
# The address domains are in the following format
# - For kernel address domains
#       [KERNEL]
# - For user process address domains
#   [xxxxx]
#   Where xxxxx may be any ascii value which uniquely identifies
#   the user mode process.
#   To allow the driver correctly configure the
#   logical instances associated with this user process,
#   the process must call the icp_sal_userStart(...)
#   passing the xxxxx string during process initialisation.
#   When the user space process is finish it must call
#   icp_sal_userStop(...) to free resources.
#   If there are multiple devices present in the system all conf
#   files that describe the devices must have the same address domain
#   sections even if the address domain does not configure any instances
#   on that particular device. So if icp_sal_userStart("xxxxx") is called
#   then user process address domain [xxxxx] needs to be present in all
#   conf files for all devices in the system.
#
# Items configurable by a logical instance are:
# - Name of the logical instance
# - The accelerator associated with this logical
#   instance
# - The execution engine associated with this logical
#   instance (For crypto instances only)
# - The ring bank associated with this logical
#   instance.
# - The response mode associated wth this logical instance (0
#   for IRQ or 1 for polled).
# - The ring for receiving and the ring for transmitting.
# - The number of concurrent requests supported by a pair of
#   rings on this instance (tx + rx). Note this number affects
#   the amount of memory allocated by the driver. Also
#   Bank<n>InterruptCoalescingNumResponses is only supported for
#   number of concurrent requests equal to 512.
#
# Note: Logical instances may not share the same ring, but
#           may share a ring bank.
#
# The format of the logical instances are:
# - For crypto:
#               Cy<n>Name = "xxxx"
#               Cy<n>AcceleratorNumber = 0|1
#               Cy<n>ExecutionEngine = 0|1
#               Cy<n>BankNumber = 0-7
#               Cy<n>IsPolled = 0|1
#               Cy<n>NumConcurrentSymRequests = 64|128|256|512|1024|2048|4096
#               Cy<n>NumConcurrentAsymRequests = 64|128|256|512|1024|2048|4096
#               Cy<n>RingAsymTx = 0-14 (Even numbers only)
#               Cy<n>RingAsymRx = 1-15 (Odd numbers only)
#               Cy<n>RingSymTxHi = 0-14 (Even numbers only)
#               Cy<n>RingSymRxHi = 1-15 (Odd numbers only)
#               Cy<n>RingSymTxLo = 0-14 (Even numbers only)
#               Cy<n>RingSymRxLo = 1-15 (Odd numbers only)
#
# - For Data Compression
#               Dc<n>Name = "xxxx"
#               Dc<n>AcceleratorNumber = 0|1
#               Dc<n>BankNumber = 0-7
#               Dc<n>IsPolled = 0|1
#               Dc<n>NumConcurrentRequests = 64|128|256|512|1024|2048|4096
#               Dc<n>RingTx = 0-14 (Even numbers only)
#               Dc<n>RingRx = 1-15 (Odd numbers only)
#
#
# Where:
#       - n is the number of this logical instance starting at 0.
#       - xxxx may be any ascii value which identifies the logical instance.
