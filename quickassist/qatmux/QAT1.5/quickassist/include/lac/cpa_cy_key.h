 *      specific to an instance.
 *
 * @description
 *      This function will query a specific instance for key and mask
 *      generation statistics. The user MUST allocate the CpaCyKeyGenStats64
 *      structure and pass the reference to that into this function call. This
 *      function will write the statistic results into the passed in
 *      CpaCyKeyGenStats64 structure.
 *
 *      Note: statistics returned by this function do not interrupt current data
 *      processing and as such can be slightly out of sync with operations that
 *      are in progress during the statistics retrieval process.
 *
 * @context
 *      This is a synchronous function and it can sleep. It MUST NOT be
 *      executed in a context that DOES NOT permit sleeping.
 * @assumptions
 *      None
 * @sideEffects
 *      None
 * @blocking
 *      This function is synchronous and blocking.
 * @reentrant
 *      No
 * @threadSafe
 *      Yes
 *
 * @param[in]  instanceHandle       Instance handle.
 * @param[out] pKeyGenStats         Pointer to memory into which the statistics
 *                                  will be written.
 *
 * @retval CPA_STATUS_SUCCESS        Function executed successfully.
