# Logical Instances Section
# A logical instance allows each address domain
# (kernel space and individual user space processes)
# to configure rings (i.e. hardware assisted queues)
# to be used by that address domain and to define the
# behavior of that ring.
#
# The address domains are in the following format
# - For kernel address domains
#       [KERNEL]
# - For user process address domains
#   [xxxxx]
#   Where xxxxx may be any ascii value which uniquely identifies
#   the user mode process.
#   To allow the driver correctly configure the
#   logical instances associated with this user process,
#   the process must call the icp_sal_userStartMultiProcess(...)
#   passing the xxxxx string during process initialisation.
#   When the user space process is finished it must call
#   icp_sal_userStop(...) to free resources.
#   NumProcesses will indicate the maximum number of processes
#   that can call icp_sal_userStart on this instance.
#   Warning: the resources are preallocated: if NumProcesses
#   is too high, the driver will fail to load
#
# Items configurable by a logical instance are:
# - Name of the logical instance
# - The accelerator associated with this logical
#   instance
# - The core the instance is affinitized to (optional)
#
# Note: Logical instances may not share the same ring, but
#           may share a ring bank.
#
# The format of the logical instances are:
# - For crypto:
#               Cy<n>Name = "xxxx"
#               Cy<n>AcceleratorNumber = 0-3
#               Cy<n>CoreAffinity = 0-7
#
# - For Data Compression
#               Dc<n>Name = "xxxx"
#               Dc<n>AcceleratorNumber = 0-1
#               Dc<n>CoreAffinity = 0-7
#
# Where:
#       - n is the number of this logical instance starting at 0.
#       - xxxx may be any ascii value which identifies the logical instance.
#
# Note: for user space processes, a list of values can be specified for
# the accelerator number and the core affinity: for example
#              Cy0AcceleratorNumber = 0,2
#              Cy0CoreAffinity = 0,2,4
# These comma-separated lists will allow the multiple processes to use
# different accelerators and cores, and will wrap around the numbers
# in the list. In the above example, process 0 will use accelerator 0,
# and process 1 will use accelerator 2
#
# NOTE: One VF has only 16 rings so the configuration that can be used
# can be 2 Cy + 1 Dc instances in KERNEL or 2 Cy + 1 Dc instances in
# SSL section or a combination of the two that doesn't require more
# than 16 rings.
